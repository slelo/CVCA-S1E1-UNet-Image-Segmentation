# Segment Vehicle LiDAR - U-Net Baseline

This project is a beginner-friendly computer vision pipeline for the Kaggle **Segment Vehicle LiDAR** competition. The goal is to detect vehicles in LiDAR-derived image tiles using semantic segmentation.

The dataset contains 160×160 images and COCO-style polygon annotations stored in a JSON file. The polygons are converted into binary masks, where vehicle pixels are labeled as `1` and background pixels as `0`.

## Current Features

* COCO-style JSON annotation loading
* Polygon-to-mask conversion using OpenCV
* PyTorch dataset and dataloader
* Minimal U-Net implementation
* Training loop with train/validation split
* BCEWithLogitsLoss baseline
* IoU validation metric
* Model checkpoint saving
* Notebook visualization of:

  * raw image
  * ground-truth mask
  * model prediction
  * prediction overlay

## Model

The current model is a small U-Net for binary semantic segmentation.

Input:

```text
3 × 160 × 160 image
```

Output:

```text
1 × 160 × 160 mask logits
```

The model uses encoder blocks, decoder blocks, transposed convolutions, and skip connections.

## Training

Run training with:

```bash
python src/train.py
```

The best model is saved to:

```text
checkpoint/best_model.pth
```

## Exploration

Use the notebook:

```text
notebooks/01_exploration.ipynb
```

to inspect images, masks, and model predictions.

## Notes

This is an initial baseline project. The current goal is to build a complete working segmentation pipeline before improving model quality.

Possible next improvements:

* BCE + Dice loss
* data augmentation
* learning rate scheduling
* better validation analysis
* Kaggle submission generation with RLE encoding
